Sprint 0.5
We decided the best way to get the data is to make daily calls to Blizzard's API 
in order to retrieve the actual auctions that are happening. To retrieve the item data, 
we will be pulling information from Wowhead.com, because they have XMLs of all of their 
item information.
Once we figured out what we needed to do, we began to try to read XML files from the website. 
We didn't have much success with this aspect, as multiple different ways were tried to no avail. 
We plan on implementing the UI on the back end of the milestone, as well as figuring out how to 
read and parse XML files from the website to store the data.

Sprint 1.0
We finished up an XML parser to help us pull data off the the Wowhead website to get 
the item data. While this may not be permanent, it is used to currently to get the data 
from the website, then back to the main activity to show data is being pulled.
As for UI, there is only a very simplistic view to show that the data is working. 
We plan on making more views for the rest of the views in the later sprints, since making 
sure we had working data was of the utmost importance for this sprint.


Sprint 1.5
For the first half of Sprint 2, we tried working with JDBC to connect to The
Undermine Journal database, but nothing proved effective in completing our objective. 
RJ talked with Professor Wilkin, who confirmed that trying to use JDBC would be very 
complicated. He suggested going to a talk on 1/31/17 regarding Python Flask, which might be 
helpful in doing what we want. If not the case, RJ plans on asking Wilkin for 
assistance in getting JDBC to work (or through another means) so that the firebase
database can be set up by the end of the sprint.
