Sprint 0.5

We decided the best way to get the data is to make daily calls to Blizzard's API
in order to retrieve the actual auctions that are happening. To retrieve the 
item data, we will be pulling information from Wowhead.com, because they have 
XMLs of all of their item information.

Once we figured out what we needed to do, we began to try to read XML files 
from the website. We didn't have much success with this aspect, as multiple 
different ways were tried to no avail. We plan on implementing the UI on the 
back end of the milestone, as well as figuring out how to read and parse XML 
files from the website to store the data.
